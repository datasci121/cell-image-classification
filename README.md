# U-NET Image Segmentation

Initially we tried to replicate the image segmentation of cell images using U-NET as proposed by U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical
Image Segmentation by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597v1.pdf.

Model performance was extremely poor.

The performance of the custom CNN for image classification is outrightly better than the U-NET model for image segmentation.
